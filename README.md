A simple application to rank a generic list of things. For instance takes a list of video games, and randomly picks 2, and the user inputs which they like better. Once a lot of pairs have been rated, can run a ranker class to rank them best to worst according to some metric (most times liked, TrueSkill, others...). Only works in command line right now, kivy version is in the works
